\usage{
super_partition(
  full_data,
  threshold = 0.5,
  cluster_size = 4000,
  partitioner = part_icc(),
  tolerance = 0.0001,
  niter = NULL,
  x = "reduced_var",
  .sep = "_",
  verbose = TRUE,
  progress_bar = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{full_data}{sample by feature data frame or matrix}

\item{threshold}{the minimum proportion of information explained by a reduced variable; \code{threshold} sets a boundary for information loss because each reduced variable must explain at least as much as \code{threshold} as measured by the metric.}

\item{cluster_size}{maximum size of any single cluster; default is 4000}

\item{partitioner}{a \code{partitioner}. See the \verb{part_*()} functions and \code{\link[=as_partitioner]{as_partitioner()}}.}

\item{tolerance}{a small tolerance within the threshold; if a reduction is within the threshold plus/minus the tolerance, it will reduce.}

\item{niter}{the number of iterations. By default, it is calculated as 20\% of the number of variables or 10, whichever is larger.}

\item{x}{the prefix of the new variable names; must not be contained in any existing data names}

\item{.sep}{a character vector that separates \code{x} from the number (e.g. "reduced_var_1").}

\item{verbose}{logical for whether or not to display information about super partition step; default is TRUE}

\item{progress_bar}{logical for whether or not to show progress bar; default is TRUE}

Partition object

\description{
\code{super_partition} implements the agglomerative, data reduction method Partition for datasets with large numbers of features by first 'super-partitioning' the data into smaller clusters to Partition.
}
\details{
\code{super_partition} scales up partition with an approximation, using Genie, a fast, hierarchical clustering algorithm with similar qualities of those to Partition, to first super-partition the data into ceiling(N/c) clusters, where N is the number of features in the full dataset and c is the user-defined maximum cluster size (default value = 4,000). Then, if any cluster from the super-partition has a size greater than c, use Genie again on that cluster until all cluster sizes are less than c. Finally, apply the Partition algorithm to each of the super-partitions.

It may be the case that large super-partitions cannot be easily broken with Genie due to high similarity between features. In this case, we use k-means to break the cluster.

set.seed(123)
df <- simulate_block_data(c(15, 20, 10), lower_corr = .4, upper_corr = .6, n = 100)

#  don't accept reductions where information < .6

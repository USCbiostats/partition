Description: A fast and flexible framework for agglomerative
    partitioning. 'partition' uses an approach called
    Direct-Measure-Reduce to create new variables that maintain the
    user-specified minimum level of information. Each reduced variable is
    also interpretable: the original variables map to one and only one
    variable in the reduced data set. 'partition' is flexible, as well:
    how variables are selected to reduce, how information loss is
    measured, and the way data is reduced can all be customized.
    'partition' is based on the Partition framework discussed in Millstein
    et al. (2020) <doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btz661>.
